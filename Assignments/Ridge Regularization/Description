Implementation of Lasso regularization for linear regression.

(Note, you are not to use modules which provide these functions - that would be too easy (no linear_model.LinearRegression, for example) but rather create them yourselves.

The dataset to use is the diabetes dataset available from the sklearn module

The diabetes dataset has 10 features, and you should use the first feature for the assignment. There are 442 samples in the dataset. 
Your goal is to take the first forty samples of the dataset to train your model, and the last forty samples are used for prediction.

Please use the Ridge regularization to fit a linear regression model. 
Report the coefficients of the model, the mean squared error on the test data, and plot the output.
