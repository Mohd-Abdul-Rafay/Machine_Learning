mplementation of linear SVM for binary classification.

(Note, you are not to use modules which provide these functions - that would be too easy (no sklearn.svm, for example) but rather create them yourselves.

Dataset should be generated via ‘make_blobs’ in sklearn and the number of samples is 100. 
Please note the generated dataset should be separable. 
Please refer to (sklearn.datasets.make_blobs — scikit-learn 1.4.1 documentationLinks to an external site.) for more details.

Please plot the maximum margin separating hyperplane within the dataset using SVM with linear kernel. 
Remove the closest support vector, redo the task and plot the new maximum margin separating hyperplane. 
What’s the takeaway by comparing the plots?
